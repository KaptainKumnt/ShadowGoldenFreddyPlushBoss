# Shadow Golden Freddy Plush Boss
A custom boss for Five Nights at F***boy's: Complete Collection

Hello, and thank you for downloading the Shadow Golden Freddy Plush Boss mod for Five Nights at F***boy's: Complete Collection. You're probably wondering how to download this mod and put this inside the game so you can play it. It's very easy really.

First, download the zip folder for this mod, obviously. It can be from the code section of the repository or from the releases section. If you do decide to download from the releases section, be sure to download one of the up-to-date releases for the best mod experience. Nothing's stopping you from downloading the older versions of this mod, but stuff will break if you use them.

Second, inside the zip folder of the mod, there should be more folders that contain certain files for the mod. Inside the folder for the Complete Collection, there is a folder called "www". The folder for the mod when you initially unzip it is supposed to act as a parallel to the www folder pathing wise.

Copy the files (not folders!) of the mod folder and put them into their respective folders of the www folder. Replace the pre-existing files when you are prompted to do so (Don't worry if you there is no prompt to replace a file if you are in the correct folder). If done right, the mod should be working as intended and nothing substansial should break.

And that concludes how to install this mod. Git Gud and have fun.
