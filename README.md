# Shadow Golden Freddy Plush Boss
(A custom boss for Five Nights at F***boy's: Complete Collection)
(...Made without RPG Maker)



Hello, and thank you for downloading the Shadow Golden Freddy Plush Boss mod for Five Nights at F***boy's: Complete Collection. You're probably wondering how to download this mod and put this inside the game so you can play it. It's very easy really.

# Installation

First, download the zip folder for this mod, obviously. It can be from the code section of the repository or from the releases section. If you do decide to download from the releases section, be sure to download one of the up-to-date releases for the best mod experience. Nothing's stopping you from downloading the older versions of this mod, but stuff will break if you use them.

Second, inside the zip folder of the mod, there should be more folders that contain certain files for the mod. Inside the folder for the Complete Collection, there is a folder called "www". The folder for the mod when you initially unzip it is supposed to act as a parallel to the www folder pathing wise.

Copy the files (not folders!) of the mod folder and put them into their respective folders of the www folder. Replace the pre-existing files when you are prompted to do so (Don't worry if you there is no prompt to replace a file if you are in the correct folder). If done right, the mod should be working as intended and nothing substansial should break.



# How to Encounter Shadow Golden Freddy Plush In-Game

(Note: You have to play in FNaFb 2/CC2, because the boss only appears there.)


Shadow Golden Freddy Plush is a powerful adversary to fight against, even moreso than his cousin, the Freddy Plush. Unlike his cousin who only has a rare chance to appear in Power 1 areas, Shadow Golden Freddy Plush can only be encountered in the only Power 5 area of FNaFb 2/CC2, **the Office**. He is encountered the same way Freddy Plush is, so just keep encountering enemies in the Office until he shows up.

And that concludes how to install this mod and how it works gameplay wise. If you want to make your mod adjecent to this using this repository, feel free to do so, just credit me for it (Or don't. It's a free world). Anyways, Git Gud and have fun.
